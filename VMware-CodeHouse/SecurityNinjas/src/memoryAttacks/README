This C program illustrates buffer overflow and integer overflow leading to buffer overflow.

attack1() is a simple example of buffer overflow vulnerable code wherein if the user enters number of characters to

overwrite return address, buffer overflow will occur.

attack2() checks for the sum of lengths of strings to be concatenated but integer overflow causes the check to fail in cases 
	for instance when one length is 0xfffffff9 and the other is 0x10f.

Solution : Check bounds for input integers separately before arithmetic operations (adding or multiplying) to avoid integer overflow    
+and use secure functions like fgets and strncpy to avoid buffer overflow
