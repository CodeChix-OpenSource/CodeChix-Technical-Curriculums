This directory contains 2 source files - file_handling_faulty.c , memory_handling.c

memory_management.c allocates a heap buffer, uses it by filling integers and reading them but fails to free the memory in the end.
We recommend you compile the code and use valgrind to analyze memory leaks
valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./memory_handling

file_handling_faulty.c shows the code where a file is generated and the quotient of 2 integers is wwritten to it
cc file_handling_faulty.c -o file_handling_faulty
./file_handling_faulty temp_file 4 0

The above divide by zero throws an error and the system exits with <0 value without freeing the resources and cleaning the system.
The code also doesn't follow error codes properly.
