The purpose of the exercise is to let students spot and fix a major SQL Injection vulnerability. 

>>CreateTable.py creates 2 tables in sqlite. Students need to be informed about the schema, so that they can design the attack accordingly. 
>>insecure_sql.py This scriptperforms a basic login. Prints a welcome message. Asks for the account type and prints the balance of the logged in user. The script is vulnerable to sql injection as inputs are not sanitized and queries are not parameterised. 

1. Install sqlite
	on linux
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev

2. Tell students about SQL schema of users and balance table (refer to create_table.py)

3. Ask students to retrieve balances of all usersvia sql injection

4. Ask students to fix the script and check solution file in secure_sql.py in solution folder.
