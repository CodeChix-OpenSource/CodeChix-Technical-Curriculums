The code in src folder contains exercises and their solutions. 
Each exercise contains its own README
There are hands on exercises available for the following:
1. Cryptography Practices : Illustrating the importance of implementation and parameters of an establishes algorithm.
2. Error Handling : Illustrating importance of cleaning temp, unimportant memory locations and folders protecting sensitive data
and gracefully handling errors without giving out information about underlying system or software
3. SQL Injection : Illustrates vulnerability of SQL code, provides scope for code injection and protective measures against it
4. Memory Management : Illutrates vulnerability of code susceptible to buffer overflow and integer overflow and practices to avoid these 
5. Input Validation : Illustrates vulnerability of front end code which performs no input filtration or validation
6. Session Management : Illustrates the importance of cookies, session ID's, their correct generation methods and how to keep them secure.
The curriculum explains these topics in brief and some other important and related topics to help get a developer acquainted with secure ways and practices of coding, knowing which functions and packages to avoid, a few common ways of attacking vulnerable code and defense mechanisms for the same etc...
